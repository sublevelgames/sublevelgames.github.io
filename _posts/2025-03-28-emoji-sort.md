Emoji Sort is a pattern recognition puzzle game where players must fill in empty cells with the correct emojis. Each puzzle presents a grid with missing emojis that follow specific patterns - such as categories, sequences, or associations. Players analyze the existing emojis to identify the pattern (animals, food chains, transportation types, etc.) and select the appropriate emojis to complete the grid.
