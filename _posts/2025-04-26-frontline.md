This is a Gamedev.js Jam 2025 submission.

A hex-based turn strategy game about finding the perfect balance. 

Strategically balance your limited supplies across units to maintain your frontline. 

Supplies below 30% severely reduce combat power, while above 80% provide tactical advantages. 

Win by balancing offense and defense to eliminate enemies or break through their frontline.
