Pipe Match is a rotating card game where the goal is to connect all pipes to the end.

Click on a pipe to rotate it clockwise. Pipes that are faded out are not connected and pipes with a dark gray background can't be moved. To undo a previous move, click the rotating arrow button. To restart the whole puzzle, click the arrow in the circle.
