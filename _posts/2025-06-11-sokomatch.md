SokoMatch 3D is a strategic puzzle game that combines block-pushing mechanics with match-3 gameplay. Push colorful animal blocks around the board to create groups of three or more matching animals, which will then disappear. Your goal is to clear all blocks from each level using the fewest moves possible. Navigate through increasingly challenging levels featuring special mechanics like ice blocks that freeze animals in place, and one-way arrow tiles that restrict your movement direction. Plan your moves carefully - some puzzles require strategic thinking to avoid getting stuck with unmatchable blocks. 

With 25 handcrafted levels, smooth 3D graphics, and intuitive controls, SokoMatch 3D offers hours of brain-teasing entertainment for puzzle lovers of all ages.
