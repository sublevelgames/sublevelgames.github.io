Woodlock is a 3D puzzle game where glowing buttons sit on the faces of a wooden cube. Each button is connected to others by burned paths — pressing one flips its neighbors too. Rotate the cube, figure out the links, and turn off all the lights in the fewest moves. 50 handcrafted levels take you from simple 2×2 cubes to brain-twisting 5×5 challenges. Can you earn three stars on every stage?
