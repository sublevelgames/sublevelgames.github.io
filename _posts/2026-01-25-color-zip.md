How to Play
Basic Rules:
- Connect dots of the same color by drawing lines
- Lines cannot cross or overlap
- Fill every cell on the grid to complete the level
- Numbers on dots show remaining moves for that color

Special Elements:
- Color Zones (🎨): Your line must pass through cells marked with specific colors
- Direction Arrows (➡️): Lines must exit these cells in the indicated direction

Tips:
- Plan your path carefully - dead ends will block your progress
- Use the hint button (💡) when you need help
- Tap "Reset" to restart the current level
- Watch for numbers on dots to plan longer paths first
