Arrows are trapped in a grid. Your job? Get them out.

Each arrow can only escape in the direction it points. But there's a catch - other arrows might be blocking the way. Figure out the right order to clear them all.

Simple rules, tricky puzzles.

Features:
- 900+ hand-picked levels
- No time pressure - think at your own pace
- Clean, minimal design
- Hint system when you're stuck

Free to play. No internet required.
