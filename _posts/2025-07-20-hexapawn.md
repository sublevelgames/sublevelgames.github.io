Hexapawn is a solved game in which two players compete with three pawns each on a 3x3 checkerboard.

The objective of this game is to train AI to reach a state where it cannot lose. In this game, the second player always wins if played perfectly, and AI learns by erasing its mistakes.

This game is explained in this [blog post](https://sublevelgames.github.io/blogs/2025-07-20-basic-game-hexapawn/).
