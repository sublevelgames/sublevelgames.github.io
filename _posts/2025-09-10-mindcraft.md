Mindcraft is a challenging 3D puzzle game that will test your spatial reasoning and strategic thinking. 

Control a rectangular block as you navigate through beautifully crafted levels, rolling and tumbling your way to the goal. But be careful - one wrong move could send you plummeting into the void!


You can add it to your Steam Wishlist! We promise to offer it at a low price, especially during the first week of release!

The game will be released in October 2025.



In the demo, only the first island is playable. In the full game, you can enjoy 10 types of gimmicks across 7 islands!
