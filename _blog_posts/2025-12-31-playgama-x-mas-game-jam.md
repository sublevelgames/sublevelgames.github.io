# What is a Game Jam?

Since I started developing games, participating in a game jam has always been on my wishlist. The term "Game Jam" originates from the jazz culture of "jamming," where musicians improvise together spontaneously. Similarly, game jams are events where developers create games improvisationally within a short timeframe based on a given theme.

There are a few general rules that apply to all jams: games must be created only during the jam period, games must align with the jam's theme, and mutual evaluation among participants takes place. Additional rules vary by jam: there may or may not be rewards, source code may or may not be required to be open, specific engines, technologies, or assets may be mandated or completely unrestricted, and rankings may be given or the focus may simply be on participation.

| Category | Rules |
|----------|-------|
| **General Rules (All Jams)** | - Must create game during jam period only<br>- Must align with jam theme<br>- Peer evaluation among participants |
| **Special Rules (Varies by Jam)** | - Rewards: Yes/No<br>- Source code disclosure: Required/Optional<br>- Engine/Tech restrictions: Specific requirements/No restrictions<br>- Rankings: Ranked/Participation-focused |

*General and Special Rules of Game Jams*

Game jams are held both offline and online, organized by various entities including companies, local communities, schools, and game engine developers. Among these, the largest platform is itch.io. On itch.io, anyone can upload games and host game jams at no additional cost. According to [a 2023 article contributed to Skeleton Code Machine](https://www.skeletoncodemachine.com/p/ten-years-of-game-jams), approximately 10,800 game jams were held on itch.io over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2023, with 250,000 people participating annually and over 500,000 games created. As of December 2025, these numbers are likely even higher. According to [annual Steam game release statistics](https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/) and [web game engine statistics for the first half of 2025 published by playgama](https://wiki.playgama.com/playgama/articles/introducing-web-based-game-engine-rankings-first-issue-h1-2025), more and more games are being released on both PC and web platforms. I personally believe that generative AI-assisted coding is having a significant impact on this trend.

Game jams serve as a venue to test the potential of ideas. The famous indie game [Baba is You](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba) also started as a [game jam version](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-is-you).

# Playgama X-Mas Things Jam

Playgama is an HTML5 platform and distributor that boasts 300 million monthly visitors. By simply integrating the Playgama SDK, developers can publish their games across various networks including y8.com, lagged.com, MSN, and Xiaomi Game Center. Of course, not all games can be published everywhere—Playgama adds networks where games will be published based on certain criteria. Sublevelgames has launched 8 games on Playgama. I believe Playgama is developing faster than other web game platforms, and communication with game managers and community managers through Discord is also smooth.

[Playgama has hosted 4 game jams so far](https://itch.io/search?q=playgama%20jam&type=jams), and this X-Mas Things Jam is the fifth. Except for the [Green Web Jam](https://itch.io/jam/green-web-game-jam-playgama), all have offered rewards, and game jams with rewards had at least twice as many submissions.

*List of Game Jams Hosted by Playgama*

The X-Mas Things Jam hosted by Playgama this time had a total prize pool of $1,000, with $250, $150, and $100 awarded to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place games selected by both participant voting and organizer selection. Notable rules for this game jam include:

1. HTML5/Web only
2. Build size under 100MB
3. Mandatory integration of Playgama Bridge SDK

These rules indicate that this game jam also serves the purpose of discovering new titles that can be served on the Playgama platform. The theme was the conflict between darkness and light, requiring participants to define dark and light elements and show them in opposition.
