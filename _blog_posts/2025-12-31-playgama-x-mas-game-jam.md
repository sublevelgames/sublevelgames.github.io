# What is a Game Jam?

Since I started developing games, participating in a game jam has always been on my wishlist. The term "Game Jam" originates from the jazz culture of "jamming," where musicians improvise together spontaneously. Similarly, game jams are events where developers create games improvisationally within a short timeframe based on a given theme.

There are a few general rules that apply to all jams: games must be created only during the jam period, games must align with the jam's theme, and mutual evaluation among participants takes place. Additional rules vary by jam: there may or may not be rewards, source code may or may not be required to be open, specific engines, technologies, or assets may be mandated or completely unrestricted, and rankings may be given or the focus may simply be on participation.

| Category | Rules |
|----------|-------|
| **General Rules (All Jams)** | - Must create game during jam period only<br>- Must align with jam theme<br>- Peer evaluation among participants |
| **Special Rules (Varies by Jam)** | - Rewards: Yes/No<br>- Source code disclosure: Required/Optional<br>- Engine/Tech restrictions: Specific requirements/No restrictions<br>- Rankings: Ranked/Participation-focused |

*General and Special Rules of Game Jams*

Game jams are held both offline and online, organized by various entities including companies, local communities, schools, and game engine developers. Among these, the largest platform is itch.io. On itch.io, anyone can upload games and host game jams at no additional cost. According to [a 2023 article contributed to Skeleton Code Machine](https://www.skeletoncodemachine.com/p/ten-years-of-game-jams), approximately 10,800 game jams were held on itch.io over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2023, with 250,000 people participating annually and over 500,000 games created. As of December 2025, these numbers are likely even higher. According to [annual Steam game release statistics](https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/) and [web game engine statistics for the first half of 2025 published by playgama](https://wiki.playgama.com/playgama/articles/introducing-web-based-game-engine-rankings-first-issue-h1-2025), more and more games are being released on both PC and web platforms. I personally believe that generative AI-assisted coding is having a significant impact on this trend.

Game jams serve as a venue to test the potential of ideas. The famous indie game [Baba is You](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba) also started as a [game jam version](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-is-you).
